      <strong>Metallica</strong> is an American
      <strong>heavy metal </strong>band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los
      Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich and
      has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's
      fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of
      the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth,
      Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members
      and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk
      Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who formed
      Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff
      Burton, and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

      Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third
      album,
      <strong>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f1Ny74_ou0" target="_blank"
          >Master of Puppets (1986)</a
        ></strong
      >
      , cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The
      band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first
      Grammy Award nomination. Their self titled fifth album, Metallica (1991),
      was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal. It
      appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial
      success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date;
      making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting
      with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica
      returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album,
      Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's
      earlier albums. The band's most recent album is Hardwired... to
      Self-Destruct (2016).
