      <strong> Metallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 </strong> when
      Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles
      newspaper, The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal
      musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron
      Maiden."Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm
      answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich
      asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song
      for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre. Slagel
      accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.
      The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after
      Ulrich and Hetfield first met.
    </p>
    The band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming
    names for a fanzine and was considering MetalMania or Metallica. After
    hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted Metallica for his band, so he suggested
    Quintana use MetalMania instead. Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement
    for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his
    expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first
    original song, "Hit the Lights", for the Metal Massacre I compilation.
    Hetfield played bass, rhythm guitar and sang while Lloyd Grant was credited
    with a guitar solo and Lars Ulrich played drums. Metal Massacre I was
    released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as
    "Mettallica", angering the band. The song generated word of mouth and the
    band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in
    Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. Their first
    live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal
    band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second
    gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, whose name was inspired
    by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.
